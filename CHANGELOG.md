1. Add MobZRarity to simplify item tooltip addition and reduces the
number of localization key-value pairs required. Common localization
keys start with "text.mobz.tier."
2. Localization key `item.mobz.spawnegg` is now `item.mobz.spawn_egg_of`
3. Metal golem can now be repaired using hardened metal ingots, this was
broken for a while
4. Fix a Wasp bug which causes vanilla bee fail to spawn #44
5. Fix toad summon crash
